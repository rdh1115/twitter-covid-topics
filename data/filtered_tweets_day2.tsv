1465071869086863364	Or are the variants a way to say u got covid even tho ur vaxxed without causing people to lose faith in vaccines https://t.co/749VjD9sh3
1465071868226912261	@EpochTimesChina @EpochTimes @WHO Because they received money from #Xi that‚Äôs why they delay announcement of Covid(sorry Chinese virus)in NOV 2019.@WHO is criminal for causing 5m death including my sister

1465071867186663428	@RonFilipkowski @JayRod212 So yet another call to violence here against any restrictions due to Covid. The guy has been trying to start stuff way too long already, when does law enforcement pay him a visit?

No, can't think of one great thing he's done, other than lighting the match for White Supremacists to commit more hate crimes."
1465071864519147523	Who needs kids when can I live a stress free life spending my money on whatever I want?  Besides it's the fucking pandemic with still a bunch of variants seemingly appearing out of nowhere, do you really want women to give birth in a time where immune systems are in danger? https://t.co/TnO7zy4zcS
1465071860153040908	@rgergelymd @CMichaelGibson I was vaccinated and had ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù COVID. However, we don‚Äôt know the impact of this new variant on ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù COVID. Israel has shutdown and will analyze data. Eager to see that report.
1465071859767169026	@Plumundun3 Thanks for getting vaccinated!  Yes, the latest research in the Delta variant says that the viral load is the same in vaxed vs. non. But if you don't get COVID in the first place, you can't spread it.  There is mixed research on masks, but plenty of research supports their use.
