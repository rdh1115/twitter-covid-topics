We need better vaccines and more vaccine options other than the big pharma mRNA crap that they are jamming down our throats.
1464725870900391940	@kwok_xian @Thereishope4us1 @antifaoperative If I'm still at risk of getting or spreading COVID while vaxxed, what is my incentive to get it? I haven't gotten it yet and I'm not vaccinated. Meanwhile, all of my vaccinated friends caught it after getting the shot.   I dont see why I should. Do you?

1464725868865937409	@vet_dot @kenklippenstein But wasn't there like a 75 year period before they finally mandated smallpox vaccination? People did not even care.
1464725868731936777	"@josh_wingrove American Heart Association Journal Publishes Data that are ""Proof"" that COVID-19 Vaccines are ""Murder""  The mRNA jab is, known not to stop people catching covid. And it is known not to stop people spreading it. I don't believe anyone disputes these facts.  https://t.co/e4GBFVCHsV"
1464725867993595904	Warnings have been coming for a long time.  If we fail to vaccinate developing nations, more variants will develop and people die. Rich nations hoarding and destroying vaccines is a bad idea.  Chickens home to roost #COVID19 #Omicron https://t.co/von3qhyr8Z
