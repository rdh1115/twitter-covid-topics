1465514412958232577	@alfonslopeztena Yes, neither the cold nor covid are anything to be afraid of. That's why I don't live in fear. If we wear a coat and hat, or a mask, it's not because were afraid, it's because we want to because it's comfortable to us. On the same note, not wearing one still isn't a strong risk.
